 * Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:
 * - `code_interpreter_call.outputs`: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code
 *   interpreter tool call items.
 * - `computer_call_output.output.image_url`: Include image urls from the computer call output.
 * - `file_search_call.results`: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
 * - `message.input_image.image_url`: Include image urls from the input message.
 * - `message.output_text.logprobs`: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
 * - `reasoning.encrypted_content`: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning
 *   item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using
 *   the Responses API statelessly (like when the `store` parameter is set to `false`, or when an
 *   organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).
